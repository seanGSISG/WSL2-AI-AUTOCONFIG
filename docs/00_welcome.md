## What You Now Have

Congratulations! You've just set up a fully-armed **agentic engineering workstation**.

Here's what's installed on your VPS:

- **A beautiful terminal** with zsh, Oh My Zsh, and Powerlevel10k
- **Modern CLI tools** like lsd, bat, ripgrep, fzf, and zoxide
- **Language runtimes** for JavaScript (Bun), Python (uv), Rust, and Go
- **Three coding agents** ready to help you build:
  - Claude Code (`cc`)
  - Codex CLI (`cod`)
  - Gemini CLI (`gmi`)
- **The Dicklesworthstone stack** for agent coordination and memory

## The Mental Model

Think of your setup like this:

```
Your laptop (cockpit) --SSH--> VPS (the engine room)
                                 |
                                 +-- tmux sessions (persistence)
                                 |
                                 +-- coding agents (the workers)
                                 |
                                 +-- NTM (the orchestrator)
```

Your laptop is just the remote control. The real work happens on the VPS.

If your SSH connection drops? No problem. Your work continues in tmux.
